### Hey.

I'm Jonathan if that wasn't obvious.

This blog is mostly about CS, philosophy, and literature with dabblings into culture.

You can find more information on me by going to the root URL of this site (because you obviously need more info about me).

If you have further questions, you can email me at [jcw [at] vivaldi.net](mailto:jcw@vivaldi.net)
